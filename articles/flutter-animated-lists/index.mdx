Often we refrain from adding animations to certain interface components due to their complexity, justifying it as an unnecessary effort with low added value, but it's not quite like that.

Our eyes are accustomed to organic movements, and seeing an item move from point A to point B, or even disappear from the screen without any transition indicating what happened, leaves us truly confused.

This situation worsens when dealing with a list of objects, as there is much more information to worry about. The more dynamic this becomes, the worse the user experience gets.

## What are Animated Lists

Like everything in Flutter, it's just another widget, but not just any widget. AnimatedList is part of the group of widgets that help in building transition behaviors in Flutter, like for example, AnimatedContainer, AnimatedCrossFade, AnimatedOpacity, and many others, which we can explore at another time.

```dart
// just another widget
AnimatedList();
```

One of the points that makes Flutter so powerful in constructing genuine experiences is precisely the availability of these plug and play animation tools. They allow us to create transitions in a simplified manner or customize them in a more complex way if necessary.

---

## Main Operation

The **AnimatedList** works similarly to the **ListView.builder**, which creates a scroll on the screen estimating the number of elements that will be needed during the build.

However, the way the **AnimatedList** decides whether to build an item or not is slightly different. Therefore, the property that receives the size of the list is called `initialItemCount`, not `itemCount` as in **ListView.builder**.

This property allows AnimatedList to set up what we'll call a "ghost list‚Äù, where the positions of the items will serve as a reference for the list to decide which items need a new build and what the animation will be.



### Implementing an Example

For now, let's just render a single card when opening the page, without the possibility of changing the list or animating it in any way:

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // With the key we will be able to manipulate the ghost list
  final _listKey = GlobalKey<AnimatedListState>();

  // The real list, which will be used to build the items
  final _myList = <String>['title1', 'title2', 'title3'];

  // Functions to manipulate the lists
  _addNewItem() {}
  _removeItem(int index) {}

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        body: SafeArea(
          // Sua animated list na √†rvore de widgets
          child: AnimatedList(

            // Unic key to each list
            key: _listKey,

            // Real list size
            initialItemCount: _myList.length,

            itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {

                // Our item, without animation for now
                return MyCard(
                  onTap: () => _removeItem(index),
                  title: _myList[index],
                );
            },
          ),
        ),
      );
}
```



### Items in our list

Now let's also create a widget that will represent our item, it will be called `MyCard`. In this example, it will receive a title, a color, and a click callback:

```dart
class MyCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final Color color;
  final VoidCallback? onTap;
  const MyCard({
    super.key,
    required this.title,
    this.onTap,
    this.color = Colors.purpleAccent,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: onTap,
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        width: double.infinity,
        margin: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
        color: color,
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            title,
            style: const TextStyle(
              fontSize: 22,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Our result so far is a simple list, which could have been created by a ListView or even a Column. But from here, it starts to get more interesting.

## Creating an animation

At the moment when **AnimatedList** builds an item, the itemBuilder function is called, and receives the following properties:

- `context` (BuildContext)
- `index` (int)
- `animation` ("Animation\<double\>"")

With an `Animation<double>` available, we can add a Transition widget within the build, with will be a parent widget of the item we are intending to render.

Flutter provides several widgets with this premise, such as: [SizeTransition](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SizeTransition-class.html), [ScaleTransition](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ScaleTransition-class.html) or [FadeTransition](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FadeTransition-class.html) for example.

> All have the `child` property, to receive the widget that will be visually affected whenever the animation property changes.
> 

Let's use a SizeTransition for now:

```dart
...
child: AnimatedList(
  key: _listKey,
  initialItemCount: _myList.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {

    // AnimatedList controls the item's transition
    // - To add: it increases the animation in ascending order
    // - To remove: it decreases in descending order

    return SizeTransition(
      sizeFactor: animation,
      child: MyCard(
        title: _myList[index],
      ),
    );
  },
),
...
```

---

## Adding and Removing Items

One important thing to remember is that whenever new items are added or removed from the actual list, we will need to notify the AnimatedList. This allows it to manage its "ghost list" at the correct `index`, and this is done via `_listKey.currentState`.

We can then create a button that will serve the purpose of including new items in our list, and also notify the **currentState**.

```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        body: SafeArea(

          // Adding a collumn
          child: Column(
            children: [
              const SizedBox(height: 50),

              // Our card will also be our button
              MyCard(
                title: 'Add new item',
                color: Colors.orange,
                onTap: _addNewItem,
              ),

              // Expand lists inside collumns
              Expanded(
                child: AnimatedList(
                  ...
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
```

![Static list with a button](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ezx7ij6zxyul7n68jf4v.png)



### Insert

Now it's simple, to make this button work, we just need to use our `_addNewItem` function and insert something into both lists (the real one, and the phantom one).

To insert items into the phantom list, we use the .`insertItem()` method, and in this list you should always insert one item at a time.

```dart
_addNewItem() {
  final index = _myList.length;
  final intem = 'title${index + 1}';

  _listKey.currentState?.insertItem(index);
  _myList.insert(index, intem);
}
```



### Remove

To remove an item, we will use the `.removeItem()` function, and there is a small difference here: in addition to the index of the item to be removed, we will also pass a builder, exactly like what we passed to the AnimatedList through the `itemBuilder` property.

<aside>
üí° **Important**: Keep the content in a separate variable before manipulating the lists, as this ensures that the card can display the correct content throughout the animation.
</aside>

```dart
_removeItem(int index) {
  final title = _myList[index];

  _listKey.currentState?.removeItem(
    index,
    (context, animation) => SizeTransition(
      sizeFactor: animation,
      child: MyCard(
        title: title,
      ),
    ),
  );
  _myList.removeAt(index);
}
```

## Result

After this, the sky's the limit. There are thousands of ways to explore this behavior in your projects, using various transitions (including at the same time) and changing behaviors such as **curve** and **duration**.

## Animating the first build

To finish, using the methods we've created here, to display an initial animation on the items, you only need to do two things:

- Tell the AnimatedList to start with no items in the ghost list, just by putting 0 in the `initialItemCount` property.
- Add the items after the page is rendered. This can be done by calling `addPostFrameCallback` within your `initState`.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) async {
    for (var i = 0; i < _myList.length; i++) {
      _listKey.currentState?.insertItem(i);
      await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    }
  });
}

...
AnimatedList(
	initialItemCount: 0,
	...
)
```

In this way, this will be our screen after the first build:
