I have been utilizing Money Notes to manage my expenses for the past four months, and it has proven to be one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in software development. This product, despite its simplicity, delivers a high-quality user experience that I am genuinely proud of.

## Stages

#### **Prototyping**
Using Miro and Figma, I began to sketch out what would be the best way to display a snapshot of the expenses for a period.
The biggest challenge here was keeping the usability simple and making the inputs practical.

#### **Backend**
A project done in NodeJs and MongoDB, which does authentication and the CRUD of the main expense information.
Here the challenge was sensational. I delved into MongoDB aggregations and understood how to build a performant data visualization.

#### **Frontend**
Flutter allowed me to create an extremely flexible app, which can be run on almost any platform; my main focus was on the web.
It allowed me to create animations and details that I had not yet had much contact with.

#### **Metrics and analyses**
Using Firebase Analytics and the chart functionality of Mongo Atlas, I assembled some metric visualizations to understand the product performance: Number of users, volume of registered expenses, received events, and others.
